# Polynomial-Regression
# Polynomial Regression Template

This notebook demonstrates the basic structure and implementation of Polynomial Regression using Python and scikit-learn. It serves as a clean template to build and visualize polynomial models.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What It Covers

- Feature transformation using `PolynomialFeatures`
- Training a `LinearRegression` model on polynomial features
- Plotting the regression curve
- Predicting new values using the model

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib

# Polynomial Regression on Salary Dataset

This notebook contains a detailed polynomial regression example using a salary dataset. It explores how polynomial regression can model non-linear relationships in salary prediction and compares it to SVR (Support Vector Regression).

---

## ðŸ“Œ What It Covers

- Loading and exploring salary data
- Using `PolynomialFeatures` for non-linear transformation
- Training a polynomial regression model
- Plotting the prediction curve
- Predicting salaries based on new inputs

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The data includes salary levels and corresponding salaries. The goal is to model the non-linear relationship between the two.
